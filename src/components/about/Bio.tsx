          With a background in computer science, my superpower is{" "}
          <em>problem solving</em>. I&apos;m excellent at breaking down weird
          and wonderful ideas and figuring out how to get them built.

          Having worked independently for years, I&apos;m agile and able to move
          quickly. I&apos;ve launched large internationaly publicised projects
          that had to work on day one so I understand the importance of
          reliability and performance.

          Finally, I&apos;m a great communicator and collaborator and understand
          that you don&apos;t always care about *how* it gets done, just that it
          gets done well and on time.
